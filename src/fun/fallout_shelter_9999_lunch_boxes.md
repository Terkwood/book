# Fallout Shelter Cheat: 9999 Lunch Boxes

This cheat works for Xbox One and requires Microsoft Windows 10.  It was discovered in the [Genie Fallout Shelter 9999 Lunch Boxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjxeQY4eaFs) video.

- You must be logged into an XBox account shared by both your Windows 10 and Xbox One.
- You need to download and install Fallout Shelter onto a Windows 10 machine using Microsoft Store.  The account must be linked to your Xbox One.
- Link to `%APPDATA%` and go up to the local dir (not Roaming), then find e.g. `BethesdaSoftworks.FalloutShelter_AAAAkfvn8vvvv\SystemAppData\wgs\000900000CB0BE87_000000000000000000000000DEADBEEF\BEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEFBEEF7`
- Use the vault file listed at [Genie Fallout Shelter 9999 Lunch Boxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjxeQY4eaFs) video or access the edited [vault file here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Terkwood/74dbc7ee3f79782c1b729b2b3986099d/raw/8fcb192103f386d8f86470c5a6a7f354da262492/Vault.sav).
- Replace one of your games with that vault file.
- Load the game on your Windows 10 machine, hit save, and wait for Xbox routines in Windows 10 to sync your data.
- Quit Windows 10 and start Fallout Shelter on your Xbox One.  Your file should sync automatically and you should have lots of available lunch boxes.
