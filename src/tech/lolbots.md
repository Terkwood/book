# lolbots

Why not just make a bot which responds ironically to our discord server?  It should train itself based on our local subgroup of freaks and weirdos.  _Obviously_, we would make the source open for the public to scrutinize, because if we don't keep tinkering frenetically with two-star projects on Github, _then we won't achieve immortality_.

We could try using the [DeepMoji](https://github.com/Terkwood/DeepMoji)  project to somehow mix sarcasm into the intellectual brew, but we still need to investigate, and make sure that this isn't going to eat up weeks of time.  I mean, we sort of coasted through that data mining course in grad school without considering the 72 Trillion Dollar AI Hype Machine that would barrel into the world a few short years after we graduated.  Dear Reader, we're not machine learning experts over here.  Just a curious application developer.

We already have an NVIDIA Jetson Nano sitting on our desk computing the moves for our [Goban](https://github.com/Terkwood/BUGOUT) using [KataGo - a slick, community-sponsored neural net](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo). Please don't judge us by the level of dust collecting on this lil' guy -- we're working in a _very dynamic environment_. ðŸ¤§

We even created 1/3 of the [necessary architecture](https://github.com/Terkwood/BUGOUT/tree/unstable/botlink) in our recent project: we could just string up a websocket from the local NVIDIA GPU, to a cloud provider, and avoid exposing our blessed domicile's network surface to the world of trolls, bots, and whatever else.  Rather than writing some sort of PULL-based situation, we like receiving pushed events from the cloud, processing them with the NVIDIA Nano GPU in a Machine Learny Sort of Way, and then responding with the answer.

## Install tensorflow on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano

Our Nano is still pretty lightly loaded.  We had to install several packages, and finally TensorFlow, to get this going.  We used the [NVIDIA instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/install-tf-jetson-platform/index.html)

## The Woe

By now I've given up on my project entirely, realizing that the model wewant to use only supports python 2, while the NVIDIA jetson nano (surprise!) wants us to install TF using python 3.

BUT WAIT THEY'RE STILL WORKING ON IT! [Here is a forked repo with active contribution](https://github.com/nklapste/DeepMoji/tree/feature/SimplePython3Migration), working toward supporting python 3 and TF 2.0.

Here is the [related PR](https://github.com/bfelbo/DeepMoji/pull/53) for the main repo

Sort of fail. [Try TF 2.0.0](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/install-tf-jetson-platform/index.html#install_multiple_versions_tensorflow).


[Others are having this same issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/34759#issuecomment-629179592)


THIS DOES NOT REALLY WORK, VERSIONS INCOMPATIBLE: We probably need to [line up versions just so](
https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/install-tf-jetson-platform-release-notes/tf-jetson-rel.html#tf-jetson-rel)...

THIS DOES NOT REALLY WORK, CRASHES: Or we could potentially [run in a container](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tensorflow-release-notes/running.html#running)

Looks like one sure-fire fix is to [build from source](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/34759#issuecomment-570102033).  In which case we would need golang so that we can install bazel

And yes, we must build bazel from source, because we're on an ARM64 platform. ðŸ¤“

## FINALLY: PLEASING SCROLL

We really needed some of this scroll.  After a bit of a struggle, we're compiling Tensorflow 2.1.0 on our NVIDIA Jetson Nano and may yet be able to Hello.
