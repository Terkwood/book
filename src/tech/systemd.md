# Systemd and Systemctl

`systemd` is really useful.  It's a great way to ensure services
start up on linux servers reliably.

Fedora CoreOS features `systemd` units in its [machine-provisioning
specification](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/fcct-config/#_configuring_systemd_units_systemd).
