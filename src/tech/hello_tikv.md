# Tinkering with TiKV

Dec 11, 2020. I am tinkering with TiKV and trying to use the rust client.

After spending some time in the rust client README but not having much success, I found [this document](https://tikv.org/docs/4.0/tasks/try/docker-stack/) explaining how to operate TiKV alone, using docker stack.
