# Deno Hype Train: Replace Some AWS Drudgery

As part of my daily development cycle, I create a couple
of virtual machine images in AWS, then forget about them
for a while.  At some point, I boot them up and use them,
and then throw them away.

Once the instances are running, I have no more need for
the AMIs from which they were created, and, crucially,
I don't want to continue spending on the snapshot volumes
to which the AMIs are registered. 

üí∏ Snapshots cost money! üí∏

So, for the last few days I've found myself following a manual workflow to clean up my newly created machine images and snapshots, and that's a big waste of time.

Instead of using the AWS command-line interface to manage the clean-up of these snapshots and machine images, I decided to write a small script using Deno!  After all, the documentation claims that it's a good fit for use cases where you would otherwise employ a small bash or python script.

Follow along and decide for yourself whether it's an improvement.

## Tedious, Motivating Example

So, this is the painfully slow workflow that I used to clean things up by hand.  Sure, it only takes a minute, or maybe two (if I'm feeling slow).  But keep in mind that I've been doing this every day for the last week... ü§¢

First, I find the images I control:

```sh
aws ec2 describe-images --owners self|grep ami
```
‚ñ∂Ô∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

```text
"ImageId": "ami-0aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
"ImageId": "ami-0bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb",
```

Deregister (disassociate) their respective volumes:

```sh
aws ec2 deregister-image --image-id ami-0aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aws ec2 deregister-image --image-id ami-0bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
```

Now that the images are deregistered, find all of our snapshots:

```sh
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --owner self | grep snap-
```

‚ñ∂Ô∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

```text
"SnapshotId": "snap-0cccccccccccccccc",
"SnapshotId": "snap-0dddddddddddddddd",
```

Finally, destroy these snapshots 

```sh
aws ec2 delete-snapshot --snapshot-id snap-0cccccccccccccccc
aws ec2 delete-snapshot --snapshot-id snap-0dddddddddddddddd
```

What colossal a waste of time!

## Pleasantly Hyped Automation 

OK, here's the fun part.  Let's rewrite this junk using the shiniest,  newest tech! ü¶ï 

Our workflow requires that we look up both Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs, as well as Snapshot IDs.  We deregister the AMIs one by one, and we delete the snapshots one by one, as well.

Executing a command via subprocess is easily accomplished using `Deno.run`.  Here we use `stdout: "piped"` because we'll want to capture the output from the command and manipulate it:

```ts
const p = Deno.run({ cmd: ["/usr/bin/aws", "ec2", "describe-images", "--owners", "self"], stdout: "piped" });

const { code } = await p.status();

if (code !== 0) {
    const rawError = await p.stderrOutput();
    const errorString = new TextDecoder().decode(rawError);
    console.log(errorString);
    Deno.exit(code);
}
```

If we were to run this command directly in a terminal, we'd see
something like this:

```json
{
    "Images": [
        {
            "Architecture": "x86_64",
            "CreationDate": "1970-01-01T08:25:24.000Z",
            "ImageId": "ami-0aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
            // ... SNIP ...
        },
        {
            "Architecture": "x86_64",
            "CreationDate": "1970-01-01T08:15:13.000Z",
            "ImageId": "ami-0bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb",
            /// ... SNIP ...
        }
    ]
}
```

Using `grep` to pull out the `ImageId` field will leave you with
an ugly line of text which you then need to further trim down to
the actual ID. And I'm too lazy to write a proper regex. üåù

Thankfully, Typescript makes this dead simple for us, since it
handles JSON very naturally:

- TODO TODO TODO FIX
- TODO TODO TODO FIX
- TODO TODO TODO FIX
- TODO TODO TODO FIX
- TODO TODO TODO FIX
- TODO TODO TODO FIX
- TODO TODO TODO FIX
- TODO TODO TODO FIX
- TODO TODO TODO FIX     below  command string


```ts
const { Images } = JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(await p.output()));

for (let { ImageId } of Images) {
  await runOrExit(
    ["aws ec2 deregister-image --image-id " + ImageId],
    undefined,
  );
}
```
