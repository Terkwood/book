# Shrine to Bill 🙏

Yes, there are only three groups I _truly_ trust in the business world.  This isn't due to any particular faults on behalf of the total system.  This is just my personal trauma speaking on behalf of the entire, 40-hour-work-week staff.

Here are the ones I know will treat me right!

- *REDACTED*  (no kiss and tell)
- Benioff
- Bill

## Sharing a Crab Image of Bill Using Robot 🤖

Because Bill is good, we need to use the LinkedIn API to SHARE a crablike image with our friends and family.

This is the prerogative of the unemployed corporate developer:  to spend 20 hours writing a program that accomplishes the same task that 2 seconds of Basic Human App Usage can accomplish.

But it is boring for me, a Bag of meat, to use my thumbs to share Printed Memorabilia.
