## Macros in Vim

Seriously, they're [SO EASY](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Macros).

Record a macro:

```text
q<letter><commands>q
```

Execute a macro `number` times, once by default:

```text
<number>@<letter>
```

## Copying Text into Other Linux Apps

It's not fun to copy text out of vim and into other linux applications,
but here's how you do it:

1. Select the text in vim using your mouse!
2. The text is now in your ["middle click register"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1129943/how-do-i-paste-from-vim-to-other-apps-with-linux)
3. You can now use the mouse middle click to paste it into other apps
