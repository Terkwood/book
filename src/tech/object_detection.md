# vision project

This is our small experiment with object detection in tensorflow.js (pre 1.0!): [vision.prawn.farm](https://vision.prawn.farm)

It does not collect any data from user devices and is intended simply as a "hello world" style introduction to object detection in TFJS.

The source for this project is available [on Github](https://github.com/Terkwood/vision).
