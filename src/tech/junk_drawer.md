# The Junk Drawer

Everything in this section has so far resisted categorization.

Maybe we'll find a place for it later.

## Stuff to Tinker With

I'd like to look further into some of these items.

- [Idris 2](https://www.idris-lang.org/) and [its github repo](https://github.com/edwinb/Idris2)
- [JavaScript murmur3 hashing at deno.land](https://deno.land/x/murmurhash/), including links to some other vanilla JS impls.
- [RedoxOS](https://www.redox-os.org/) is a Unix-like Operating System written in Rust, aiming to bring the innovations of Rust to a modern microkernel and full set of applications.
- [Dev Fonts preview page](https://devfonts.gafi.dev/)
- [Sparkfun: How to Use a Multimeter](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/all)

## Articles

## Papers

- [On the Measure of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547). "To make deliberate progress towards more intelligent and more human-like artificial systems, we need to be following an appropriate feedback signal: we need to be able to define and evaluate intelligence in a way that enables comparisons between two systems, as well as comparisons with humans."
