# BUGOUT: Play Go against AI ðŸ’ª and Human Friends ðŸ‘ª

[BUGOUT](https://github.com/Terkwood/BUGOUT) provides a web interface to [KataGo](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo), a leading, community-driven AI implementation to the [classic board game, Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)).  

BUGOUT also features a multiplayer option for playing against human friends, if you're lucky enough to have them.

BUGOUT's web interface is a [derivative](https://github.com/Terkwood/Sabaki) of [Sabaki](https://github.com/SabakiHQ/Sabaki), the much-loved desktop app which is already capable of hooking into KataGo, [Leela Zero](https://zero.sjeng.org/home), and [GNU Go](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/).
