# A Happy Ending

There isn't much work left before the AI subsystem is complete.  It's already possible to play against KataGo through the web interface, if you're patient enough to run a read-eval-print-loop and put Kata's pieces on the board manually.

After just a few more hours of work, I'll be able to head to my website from anywhere in the world, and play a power-efficient little bot that's just right for my skill level.

And then, free from the lamentable desire for human interaction, I'll play against my own, new type of friend:  a friend born of silicon of and parallel arithmetic.
