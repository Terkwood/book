# BUGOUT: Play Go against Strong AI and Human Friends

[BUGOUT](https://github.com/Terkwood/BUGOUT) provides a web interface to [KataGo](a/b/c), a leading, community-driven AI implementation to the [classic board game, Go](a/b/c).  

BUGOUT also features a multiplayer option for playing against human friends, if you're lucky enough to have them.

BUGOUT's web interface is a [derivative](path/to/fork) of [Sabaki](path/to), the much-loved desktop app which is capable of hooking directly into KataGo, Leela Zero, and GNU Go.

## Emotional Backdrop

I started playing GO sometime during high school.  Several of my friends also learned to play.  We would often play chess, for which I had a neat little carrying case with a simple game clock, a rollout board, and sturdy pieces.  I came into a possession of a GO board of standard dimensions, and used plastic pieces that were just heavy enough to feel like they mattered.

We would sometimes meet at a Chinese dive on West 10th Street in Indianapolis, and consume inexpensive but delicious food, and play.

Eventually I got my board signed by [VICTOR WOOTEN](TODO) while attending a concert performance given by [The Flecktones](TODO) at the [Indiana Roof Ballroom](TODO):  we had been playing some small rounds prior to the start of the concert.  It must have been 1999.

The music was great, and the signature fueled my fire.

GO felt differently than chess.  There was a sense of immense possibility.  There was time to think about the future.  Winning was hard.  Getting your skill up with a same-stage newbie was exhilarating, because we grew together. I was captivated.

In college I dreamt that one day I would wake to the sound of an obstreperous trumpet, having been mired in games and strenuous efforts to build some sort of ultimate strategy.  I dreamt that I woke to a horn and a vision of clear dawn.

The actual time I've spent playing GO in my life is tiny.  Life goes on, and its daily demands slowly obscure our roots.

Still, the aesthetic delight of GO has been enjoyed by millions of individuals over the centuries, and it's this very beauty which has inspired my work over the last nine months.

GO is a game which helps me combat the lassitude of experience and boredom.

GO is not a game which must be won.  It's enough to face a player whose skill exceeds yours, and to learn.  When I play 9x9 against KataGo running on a 5W NVIDIA board, I'm happy if I manage not to lose an embarrassing number of pieces.

_GO keeps me *sharp*_.
