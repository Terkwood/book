# Lab Notes

Today we're attempting to reinitialize the entire effort.

## State of Affairs: May 21, 2020

- The [outdoor temp microcontroller](https://github.com/Terkwood/prawnalith/tree/unstable/microcontrollers/area_dht11_esp8266) _lives_.
- We completely abandoned [some work to simplify the data model](https://github.com/Terkwood/prawnalith/pull/98).  Revisiting this would be conscientious, as the work is not difficult.
